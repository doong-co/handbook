## About KodeQ

### Our Mission
  KodeQ's mission is to connect top front-end engineers globally with top US companies, deliver top consultancy and development service, and provide these engineers with a world class environment to grow and innovate. Our current recruitment and development office is in Saigon, Vietnam.

### How we started
  Started in 2012 after recognizing the issues of communication, culture, and timezone.

### What's next for us
  Focus on increasing the communication quality, make current clients happier, and acquire more clients.

  In order to expand our business while driving more innovation, we're aiming to run more in-house software products in the future.


## Your day 1 at KodeQ

### Our Products
  
  All companies sell some form of products including service companies like KodeQ. So what are we _building_ and _selling_? what are KodeQ's products?

  1. As a software development company, the most visible, tangible product that we deliver to our customers is _software code_. We always strive for quality, beautiful code that's non-buggy, well-structured, and adhering to requirements.
  2. However, as most devs don't realize, in order to develop good software as mentioned above, we must develop an internal set of practices and processes that faciliates first-class communication and healthy professional relationship with the client's team. This _set of practices and processes_ is our most important product and more often than not, this product is unrecognized by individuals coming from other outsourcing companies, so it is important for you to know it on your day 1 as you'll be joining us to build this product.

### What we value 
  
  1. We aim to be different from traditional outsourcing companies, so don't be surprised when some of your past experiences with many other outsourcing companies don't apply here. _Innovation_ is why we exists, and we drive innovation by encouraging you to see problems with your daily activities at KodeQ and try to come up with solutions.

  2. Agile is the key to solving problems successfully. With anything you do, we encourage you to think _agile_ and think _lean_. That means when attacking a problem, you should start with a small solution, then create a schedule to revisit and grow that very solution over time.

  3. _Leadership_. All organizations want leadership. This is the very element that not play key roles in faciliating business expansion, but, in fact, a value proposition in our consultancy service. Top software firms not only implement working software, but also lead the client teams to the right technology direction and strategy.

### Becoming successful at KodeQ
  

  > “There is only one boss, and whether a person shines shoes for a living or heads up the biggest corporation in the world, the boss remains the same. It is the customer! The customer is the person who pays everyone’s salary and who decides whether a business is going to succeed or fail. In fact, the customer can fire everybody in the company from the chairman (CEO) on down, and he can do it simply by spending his money somewhere else. Literally everything we do, every concept perceived, every technology developed and associate employed, is directed with this one objective clearly in mind – pleasing the customer.” 
  > - _Sam M. Walton, CEO Wal-Mart_

  Although we're not a fully grown company yet, we strive to bring KodeQ's capability to the same level as the world's leading consultancy firms: Deloitte, McKinsey, BCG... Our only boss is always the customer and our goal is to provide the customer with top consultancy service. 

  Below are the 8 levels of consultancy mastery as outlined by the Harvard Business Review with 8 being the highest level. We're currently at number 2, and our next milestone is to become 3, 4, and 5.

  1. Providing information to a client.
  2. Solving a client’s problems.
  3. Making a diagnosis, which may necessitate redefinition of the problem.
  4. Making recommendations based on the diagnosis.
  5. Assisting with implementation of recommended solutions.
  6. Building a consensus and commitment around corrective action.
  7. Facilitating client learning—that is, teaching clients how to resolve similar problems in the future.
  8. Permanently improving organizational effectiveness.


  In order to solve our current organizational problems and move up to the next levels, we need your collaboration on the following activites:

  * Open up to your team and client teams. Reach out and make lots of friends. Never undermine the power of _networking_. Coming from many different industries, the client teams usually have a lot of experiences and knowledge spanning a vast array of subjects, and amazingly they are always open to share these experiences. You'll find yourself learning a lot from these extraordinary professionals.
  * Be a team player. Help your team produce results as a team. Don't be a lonely star in the lonely sky, but stand up for and mentor less-experienced team members. Lead them by your persuasion and making logical arguments. Brainstorm and implement practices and processes to solve problems in human management and productivity. Following this guide, you will help your team members reach successes, in which you will find your own success as a leader.
  * Give direct and straightforward opinions to your peers and management. Let them know how they can improve. You should not always agree, but, instead, provide clear and professional counter arguments to challenge the status quo. Unlike other traditional companies, your opinions are valuable to us.
  

### Now, for kicking it started
  * Feel free to go around and introduce yourself to your US team.
  * Read all necessary documentation.
  * Create a PR to update any documentation if it seems out-of-date (icluding this handbook).
