## About KodeQ

### Our Mission
KodeQ's mission is to connect top front-end engineers globally with top US companies, to deliver top consultancy and development service, and to provide these engineers with a world class environment to grow and innovate. 

### Our story
Having seen many US companies try work with offshore development teams and fail to deliver high-quality results due to barriers in communication, culture, and timezone, we set out to challenge ourselves to innovate traditional management techniques and corporate culture to solve this longlasting problem and unite the workforces from two opposite sides of the world. 

We began working on our idea in 2012 by assembling a small part-time freelancer team for a startup named WingStats. After many trials and errors in recruitment and management, we have successfully improved our productivity and quality to acquire The Weather Company, a $2B US media company now part of IBM, as our next client. 

Today, KodeQ remains a young and dynamic startup, and like many other startups, it has a long way to go and many processes to build in order to align itself with its vision and become one of the top companies this industry.

### What's next for us
Focus on what we do best and do it better by taking on more responsibility for the current clients, increasing clients' dependence, acquiring more clients, and reaching out to more top-rank developers.

We're also looking into expanding our business while driving more innovation by inventing and running in-house software products in the future.

## Your day 1 at KodeQ

### Our Products
  
All companies sell some form of products including service companies like KodeQ. So what are we _building_ and _selling_? what are the products of KodeQ?

  1. As a software development company, the most visible, tangible product that we deliver to our customers is _software code_. We always strive for quality, beautiful code that's non-buggy, well-structured, and adhering to requirements.
  2. However, as most devs don't realize, in order to develop good software as mentioned above, we must develop an internal set of practices and processes that faciliates first-class communication and healthy professional relationships with the client teams. This _set of practices and processes_ is our most important product and more often than not, this product is unrecognized by individuals coming from other outsourcing companies, so it is important for you to know it on your day 1 as you'll be joining us to build this product.

### What we value 
  
  1. We aim to be different from traditional outsourcing companies, so don't be surprised when some of your past experiences with many other outsourcing companies don't apply here. _Innovation_ is why we exists, and we drive innovation by encouraging you to see problems with your daily activities at KodeQ and try to come up with solutions.
  
  2. Agile is the key to solving problems successfully. With anything you do, we encourage you to think _agile_ and think _lean_. That means when attacking a problem, you should start with a small solution, then create a schedule to revisit and grow that very solution over time.
 
  3. _Leadership_. All organizations want leadership. This element that not only plays key roles in faciliating business expansion, but is in fact a value proposition of our consultancy service. Top software firms not only implement working software, but also lead the client teams to the right technology direction and strategy.

 
### Becoming Successful at KodeQ
  

> "There is only one boss, and whether a person shines shoes for a living or heads up the biggest corporation in the world, the boss remains the same. It is the customer! The customer is the person who pays everyone's salary and who decides whether a business is going to succeed or fail. In fact, the customer can fire everybody in the company from the chairman (CEO) on down, and he can do it simply by spending his money somewhere else. Literally everything we do, every concept perceived, every technology developed and associate employed, is directed with this one objective clearly in mind - pleasing the customer." 
> _Sam M. Walton, CEO Wal-Mart_   

#### Professional Consultancy 

As a service company, we constantly strive to bring KodeQ's capability to the next level. We have realized that the only way to rise above the rest is to become on the same level as the world's leading consultancy firms: Deloitte, McKinsey, BCG... Aligning ourselves with these companies, our organization becomes flat, our only boss is always the customer, and our goal is to provide the customer with top consultancy service.

Below are the 8 levels of consultancy mastery as outlined by the Harvard Business Review with 8 being the highest level. 

  1. Providing information to a client.
  2. Solving a client's problems.
  3. Making a diagnosis, which may necessitate redefinition of the problem.
  4. Making recommendations based on the diagnosis.
  5. Assisting with implementation of recommended solutions.
  6. Building a consensus and commitment around corrective action.
  7. Facilitating client learning - that is, teaching clients how to resolve similar problems in the future.
  8. Permanently improving organizational effectiveness.

We're currently at number 2, and our next milestone is to become 3, 4, and 5.

#### Moving up

In order to solve our current organization's problems and move up to the next levels, we need your collaboration on the following activites:

  * Open up to your team and client teams. Reach out and make lots of friends. Never undermine the power of _networking_. Coming from many different industries, the client teams usually have a lot of experiences and knowledge spanning a vast array of subjects, and amazingly they are always open to share these experiences. You'll find yourself learning a lot from these extraordinary professionals.
  * Be a team player. Help your team produce results as a team. Don't be a lonely star in the lonely sky, but stand up for and mentor less-experienced team members. Lead them by your persuasion and making logical arguments. Brainstorm and implement practices and processes to solve problems in human management and productivity. Following this guide, you will help your team members reach successes, in which you will find your own success as a leader.
  * Give direct and straightforward opinions to your peers and management. Let them know how they can improve. You should not always agree, but, instead, provide clear and professional counter arguments to challenge the status quo. Unlike other traditional companies, your opinions are valuable to us.
  

### Kicking it started
